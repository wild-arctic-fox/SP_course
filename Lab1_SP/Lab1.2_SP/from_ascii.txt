Tonight, you look under your bed, and lo and behold, 
you find a monster! And you're immediately eaten. 
Now, if you hadn't looked for the monster, 
you wouldn't have found it and you'd still be happy in your bed, 
instead of being slowly digested in the stomach sac of the creature. 
But, with any luck, your sister or your brothers might have heard your screams, 
and your endeavor will serve as a valuable lesson to them.
